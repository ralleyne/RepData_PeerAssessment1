# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1
This  assumes that the data file is unzipped as activity.csv 

## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
acts<-read.csv("activity.csv")
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
act_agg<-aggregate( steps~date, act, sum)
hist(act_agg$steps) 
mean(act_agg$steps)
median(act_agg$steps)
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
